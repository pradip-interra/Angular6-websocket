# Websocket

This is a simple project to show how we can easily connect to a websocket, send/receive data and close the websocket. 
We pick up the publicly available websocket wss://echo.websocket.org which will just echo the input string. Basically
we are trying to build an Angular6 application similar to https://websocket.org/echo.html. 

## Steps:

* npm install

* npm start

* Open web browser http://localhost:4200/

## Recording
Please refer to the recorded demo available here (websocket_demo.mp4) for a brief introduction of the functionality.
